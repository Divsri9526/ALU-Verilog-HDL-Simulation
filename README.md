# 16-bit and 32-bit ALU Design in Verilog

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design, implementation, and verification of 16-bit and 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) using Verilog HDL. The ALUs are capable of performing arithmetic and logical operations such as:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT
- Logical left and right shift

The design is modular, parameterized, and tested using simulation tools.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Verilog HDL
- Testbenches (Verilog)
- Icarus Verilog (Simulator)
- EDA Playground (Online simulation)

## 📂 File Structure
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `alu_16bit.v` | 16-bit ALU module |
| `alu_16bit_tb.v` | Testbench for 16-bit ALU |
| `alu_32bit.v` | 32-bit ALU module |
| `alu_32bit_tb.v` | Testbench for 32-bit ALU |
| `waveform_screenshots/` | Simulation results (images) |

## 🚀 How to Simulate
You can simulate this project using [EDA Playground](https://edaplayground.com/):
1. Paste the design and testbench files.
2. Select **Icarus Verilog** as the simulator.
3. Run simulation and observe the waveform or console output.
